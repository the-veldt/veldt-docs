The feed can be filtered by ecosystem and sector to get specific feed of content for whatever is specific to your needs. You can also search for niche areas like “decentralized training” to build a custom feed of related content. 

When on the feed, the agent can see all of the items in the feed in addition can see what content you are hovered over top of. When you hover over content on the site, it pins the text to your agent’s prompt for easy reference.
