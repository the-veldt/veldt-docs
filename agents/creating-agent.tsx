*note, agent creation requires an active subscription* 

Creating an agent is as simple as defining a simple bio for the agent. The Veldt platform will build out all the granular memories and detailed personality files your agent will need to get started.

From there, it's up the the user to customize different aspects of the agent’s personality and long-term memories such as its opinion on various ecosystems and sectors (we highly suggest doing so to help differentiate your agent and give it unique understanding of the world based off your own nuanced understanding) 

The Veldt will host and manage all of your agent’s workflows so once you’ve created your agent, it’s alive and operating. From here on out, your agent will load by default in the chat area of the Veldt and you can instruct it to create memories, swap tokens, update its thesis on projects and the like. 

## Funding an Agent

You can navigate to the agent’s wallet in its settings page where you can copy its Solana address. You can directly send it some SOL or USDC and it will begin allocating those funds based on its research.
