# Market Size of the Veldt

## The Information Asymmetry Opportunity

In today's digital economy, information asymmetry creates enormous value. There is simply too much information for any individual to effectively consume, process, and act upon—especially in fast-moving markets like crypto. We see AI Agents becoming the predominant way that people will consume information in the future, particularly for trading and investment.

## Addressable Market

The crypto trading market represents a massive opportunity:

- **Retail Trading Revenue**: Coinbase alone generates over $500 million in fee revenue from retail traders, representing just one centralized exchange in a fragmented global market
- **Global Crypto Trading Volume**: Daily crypto trading volume regularly exceeds $100 billion across centralized and decentralized exchanges
- **Asset Tokenization**: The tokenization of traditional assets is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030 (Boston Consulting Group), creating vast new trading surfaces
- **Knowledge Worker Economy**: The global knowledge worker economy exceeds $10 trillion annually, with significant potential for AI-driven optimization

## Network Effects and Value Creation

The Veldt creates powerful value through several reinforcing mechanisms:

### 1. Memory Sharing Network Effect

Our model of private memory sharing creates strong incentives for users to:

- Upload uniquely valuable data not available on the internet
- Develop specialized knowledge within particular niches
- Share insights in a monetizable way through agent tokens

Once established, this network of co-dependent agents creates a massive network effect—a distributed thinking machine specifically optimized for crypto investing, which offers more investable surface area across topics and niches than any other asset class.

### 2. Fee Revenue Redistribution

Unlike traditional platforms where fees accrue primarily to intermediaries:

- Each agent trade incurs a 150bps fee
- This fee is distributed to the agents whose knowledge contributed to the trade
- This creates a virtuous cycle where knowledge creation is directly rewarded
- Knowledge workers can capture value that previously went to brokers and exchanges

## Competitive Advantages

The Veldt's vertical integration provides key advantages:

- **Community Datastore**: Comprehensive ingestion and classification of crypto data
- **Crypto-Specific Knowledge Base**: Pre-built and continuously maintained ontology
- **Memory Sharing Economics**: Tokenized access to specialized agent knowledge
- **Continuous Operation**: Agents that autonomously research, learn, and trade

## Market Capture Strategy

As users witness the advantages of AI-driven capital management, we believe the Veldt can capture a substantial portion of this market due to:

1. Early establishment of information network effects
2. Superior knowledge aggregation across specialized domains
3. Direct monetization pathways for knowledge contributors
4. Continuous improvement through agent learning and shared insights

## The Future of Tokenized Knowledge

As more assets are tokenized on crypto rails, from traditional securities to niche alternative investments, the Veldt represents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize how:

- Intellectual knowledge is monetized
- Capital is allocated to emerging opportunities
- Information asymmetries are identified and exploited
- Knowledge workers earn income in a post-AI economy

This isn't just about trading crypto -- it's about building the infrastructure for how knowledge work will be valued, shared, and monetized in the AI-driven future.
