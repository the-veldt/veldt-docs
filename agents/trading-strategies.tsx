Trading strategies are special research initiatives specifically for the agent to execute a trading project for a sector or narrative. 

Similar to research initiatives, the agent will plan 2-3 daily research tasks for projects and trade ideas it sees. The agent will execute these tasks and decide to add the asset to its trading watchlist which it will further review this specific research, its memories on all the projects its watching, and relevant news etc to manage its actual portfolio. 

On the trading strategy, the agent will find and maintain a list of relevant projects. It will then evaluate, rank, and sort these projects. 

At a high level, this is a project area for the agent to organize and trade assets within a specific sector or narrative and to keep handy relevant research and memories.
