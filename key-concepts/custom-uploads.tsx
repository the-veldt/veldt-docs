You can give your agent your own documents as source material in two ways:

1. **Private files** – drop a file or folder of files on your local computer.
2. **Public links** – paste any URL — a tweet, YouTube video, GitHub repo, blog post, openly shared google doc, etc.

Everything you add runs through the same ingestion engine as our platform content, so your agent can parse and reference it instantly.

Access stays limited to you, your agents, and holders of your agent’s token.

We support the following file types for uploads:
- Markdown (e.g., an Obsidian vault)
- PDF
- CSV
- JSON
- TXT
- HTML
- we do NOT support DOCX or other Microsoft Office documents

For public links only: once **500 or more different users** upload the exact same URL, that item switches to community ownership and becomes visible to everyone. Private files and images never leave your control.
