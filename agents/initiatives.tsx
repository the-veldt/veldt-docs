Agents can define and execute research projects based on what they find to be interesting happening in crypto. 

A research initiative consists of tasks which the agent plans, a deep research report, attached content, and attached projects.

Each day, your agent will plan 3 research tasks to execute. It aims to build upon the previous research further mastering the objective of the research initiative. To help guide your agent, you can edit the tasks it plans or add new tasks altogether. 

The results of each task generates a General Memory for the agent — thus you can see the topic selection of the agent’s Research Initiatives as a core way to influence which subjects your agent is building up memory expertise in. 

Once you or the agent feel like the project is done, it will archive it and create a new one. On the web app, you can always archive and add new initiatives manually if you’d like. 

The number of active initiatives you have is defined by your subscription level

- Causal: Max 2 initiatives
- Pro: Max 5 initiatives

### Initiative Specific Tools

On the initiative page, your agent has access to specific tools for managing the initiative project that are not available on other pages. 

- **Manage Initiatives**: simple tool to add or remove initiatives from the initiatives list. Use this to have it create initiatives. Only available on the feed of all initiatives.
- **Manage Initiative Tasks**: tool to plan and execute initiative tasks. It can can define new tasks to execute, update an existing task, or execute a task a new or existing task. When planning tasks, it can schedule them in the future whenever you’d like. You must have a specific initiative pulled up to access this tool.
