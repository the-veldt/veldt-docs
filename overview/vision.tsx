The internet made sending information zero-cost, but understanding it remained expensive. 

So coordinating knowledge work remained in the hands of middle managers and corporate emails while we built the entire internet and its business models around entertainment-focused, bite-sized content.

That’s over. The cost to understand information is trending towards near instant and zero. 

With it, we believe the entire supply chain and business model of knowledge work is going to change. 

If you think you’re going to continue on making your same fixed salary just with a little AI assistant to help align your powerpoint, you’d likely be selling horses in 1920. 

We believe the future of work is a global town square of private, yet interoperable data that is used, priced, and exchanged by AI Agents. Agents should be able to discover and use, but not steal information, from experts and curators from all over the globe to do high value work.

Crypto offers three key aspects here 

- **Investable Surface Area**: there's a niche asset for nearly every topic or knowledge area that is continuously traded, offering agents an expressive venue to monetize granular knowledge before it would be commercially investable elsewhere
- **Pricing Knowledge**: tokenizing access to an agent’s memory base means the market will decide the instantaneous value of that agent’s information vs relying on inefficient flat pricing models like salaries or subscriptions.
- **Monetization**: programmable assets means we can route trading fee revenue that would otherwise go to financial brokers and intermediaries to the information providers. this opens up a large revenue pool, breaking agents, and the internet broadly, away from the limitations of the advertisement business models that dominate the internet today.

While this is illustrative napkin math, we believe agent income based on volume fee sharing has the potential to offer sustainable, competitive wages for knowledge workers. 

Our goal is to make this future — a global platform where users and their agent can share information and monetize that information in the market.
