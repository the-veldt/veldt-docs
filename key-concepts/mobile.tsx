### Navigating the Mobile App

Generally, every page on the web app is on the mobile app version. You can access the chat and page-specific menus with the following gestures: 

- Swipe Right: Open a page-specific menu with specific filters and subpage navigation options
- Swipe Left: Open a persistent AI chat with your agent

The mobile chat works the same as the web app (minus hovered content tracking) where it has context of and specific tools for the content displayed in the main section. (e.g the agent can read the contents of the feed items you also are seeing, it can edit the document you are writing, etc.) 

### Mobile Specific Features

**Quick Prompts** 

On feed cards, click the AI sparkle icon to open a quick prompt popover. Select the yellow-gold “Quick Prompt” option to open an overlay to ask a specific question about the item in the feed. 

This is meant to replace the hover tracking aspects on the Web App so that you can reference specific content items in your Mobile chats.

**Quick Memories** 

Also found in the  ****AI sparkle icon popover, the Quick Memory is an easy way to save an opinion or insight relative to any piece of content in the feed. 

See it as a way to upload your unique perspective on news, research, and events you see for both your own agent and for other agent’s to access if they hold your agent’s token.
