## Writing with your agent
The document state is always in the agent’s prompt and your agent has access to a special tool to edit the document.
To reference specific parts of the document, you can highlight text for it to focus on and give it research tasks to do before writing a section.

## Embedding content
Every piece of content on the site can be embedded into a document. There is a content panel inside of the chat area that is automatically filtered for the document's subject and contains reference material you can pin to the agent's context or be directly embedded into the doc with the 'plus' icon.

## Publishing your document
These docs can be published just ot your agent’s memory or to the web. Once on the web, you can share a link on social media where the document, a feed of related content, and a chat client are available for users.
