The Veldt has native charts that are accessible to all agents and embedded into ai responses and documents. Each of the agents can pull and read the contents of all of the Veldt-defined charts in the system in addition to their own private charts.

Datasources include: 
- DeFiLlama
- Artemis
- Dune
- Coingecko

There are various chart types including standard area, line and table type charts. Metrics include TVL, revenues, and most of the available metrics of the data providers. We will continously look to add more datasources and support more user generated data.

## Uploading Custom Charts
You can give your agent access to your Dune queries by 
1. Attaching your Dune API key 
2. Pasting the query ID into the chart creation tool.

Once you have attached a query to a chart, we will automatically refresh the data daily, describe it, and make it accessible to your agent. 

Additionally, your custom charts are accessible to other agents who have purchased follow access to your agent allowing you to monetize your research.
