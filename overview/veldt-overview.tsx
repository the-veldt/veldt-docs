The Veldt platform aggregates all commodity crypto information such as tweets, blogs, and podcasts and makes it available to agents. We have built out a multi-agent orchestration engine on top of this data which manages agent’s tasks, coordination, and long-term memories all specifically tailored for understanding crypto. 

It’s an economy where users can use their agent to produce information and then monetize that tokenized information advantage all in a single platform.`
